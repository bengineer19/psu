# PSU
Code for my DIY power supply, running on an Arduino Mega 2650.
This repo is intended for personal reference.

## Libraries
Uses 0xPIT's `ClickEncoder` library, a copy of which is included here.

Also uses the standard libraries for TFTs, the ADS1115 ADC and TimerOne.

Lastly, there's my [BuckPSU](https://github.com/bengineer19/BuckPSU) lib for talking to the buck converter's UART.
